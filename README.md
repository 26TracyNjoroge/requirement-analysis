# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository is a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing effective requirement analysis in the software development lifecycle. It includes documentation, requirement analysis techniques, and best practices for gathering, analysing, and validating software requirements. This is a critical foundation that reduces rework, ensures alignment with business objectives, and delivers solutions that truly address user needs.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is a phase in software development in which the project team gathers, analyses, and defines the requirements for the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
* **Clarity and Understanding:** It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
* **Scope Definition:** Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
* **Basis for Design and Development:** Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
* **Cost and Time Estimation:** Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
* **Quality Assurance:** Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
